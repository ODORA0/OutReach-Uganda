# GoFundMe Campaign: Hope for Makerere–Kivulu

**Title**: Empower 500+ Vulnerable Children in Makerere–Kivulu

## 📖 The Story

In the heart of Kampala, nestled within the Makerere–Kivulu community, hundreds of children wake up every day with big dreams but limited opportunities.

For many of these children, access to a safe play space, a nutritious meal, or even basic school supplies is a daily challenge. But despite the hardships, there is **hope**, **resilience**, and an unshakeable **joy**.

**Outreach Uganda** is on a mission to bridge the gap. We believe that every child deserves the chance to learn, play, and grow with dignity.

## 🌟 Real Impact

Take **Sarah**, for example. Two years ago, she was out of school and selling items on the street to help her family. Through our program, she is now back in class, top of her grade, and dreaming of becoming a doctor. Your support makes stories like Sarah's possible.
